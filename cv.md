## 📖 Briefly about myself: ⬇️

I started my career as a technical designer and a machine operator at advertising and printing company. After two years of working experience I decided to learn something I was interested in. My main goal is to become a Web Developer. I believe that I'm able to reach the target. That's why I am ready to learn as much as I am capable of.
